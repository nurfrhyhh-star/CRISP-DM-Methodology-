  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely used
    data science methodology that provides a structured and iterative approach
    to solving real-world data problems.

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
     CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining,
    is a widely used framework that defines the key stages of a data analytics 
    or data science project. It provides a clear, structured approach that helps 
    teams plan, manage, and execute projects effectively, ensuring that analytical 
    work remains aligned with business goals. By following this methodology, 
    organizations can improve efficiency, minimize costly mistakes, and increase
    the likelihood of delivering meaningful and actionable results from their data.

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      
   CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) was 
   developed in the 1990s by a consortium of organizations including 
   Teradata, SPSS, Daimler-Chrysler, and OHRA. It builds on earlier 
   data analysis approaches such as KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) 
   and SEMMA, refining their ideas into a more practical and widely 
   applicable framework for data science. The original goal of CRISP-DM 
   was to provide a standardized way to structure data mining projects, 
   making them faster, easier to manage, more repeatable, and effective
    across a wide range of industries.
